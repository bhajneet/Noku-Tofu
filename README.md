# Noku-Tofu
DockbarX theme

Find where your dockbarX themes are (for me it's ~/.dockbarx/themes) and place inside it the NokuTofu.tar.gz and Foyu.tar.gz in the popup_styles folder (you may have to create this folder). The rest of the files are for tweaking and repackaging into the tar.gz. You can re-color them with the resources here.
