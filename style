## Based on Radience popup style by nale12

## Rows that begins with # are comments
## Change the name if you make a new style
name=Foyu

## Remove the # in front of a setting to start using it.
## All the commented options in this file has the default value.

## It's possible to make styles intended for certain themes.
## only_for_themes option is a comma separted list of the
## themes that are meant to use it. If DockbarX uses
## a theme not listed here, the style won't
## show up in the list over styles in preference dialog.
## Use this only if you think your popup_style makes little
## or no sense in other themes.
#only_for_themes=COMMA_SEPARATED_LIST_OF_THEMES_HERE

## To add a background picture to the style simply add a file
## named background.png to the arcive. The picture is automaticly
## tiled to fill the popup. If the picture has transparency it can
## be used together with gradients and the background color. 
## Keep the file as small as possible.

######## Popup #########
## Thickness of the border (in pixels)
border_width=14

## The color and alpha for the border of the popup
## Alpha goes from 0 (completely transparent) to 100 (completely opaque)
## Remember that this alpha always in 100 if a non-composited window manager is used.
border_color="#313436"
border_aplha=100

## If border_color2 is used that color is the outer border color
## while border_color becomes the inner border color.
border_color2="#313436"
border_alpha2=100

## The radius of the corner roundness (in pixels).
popup_roundness=0

## The amount of pixels around the actual content of the popup
## This number includes the border.
popup_padding=0

## Size of the arrow that points towards the application button (in pixels).
arrow_size=0
## The distance between the popup and the application button.
## A negative number makes the arrow overlap the application button.
popup_distance=0

## Padding and distance for the locked list
locked_list_padding=5
locked_list_distance=0

## Linear gradients
## You can use up to three linear gradients at once. Just copy-past and
## change thenumber at the end of gradient to 2 or 3 to set the options for
## the second or third gradient.
## To use a linear gradient, just set use_popup_linear_gradient to 1.
use_popup_linear_gradient1=1
## The angle sets the direction of the linear gradient in degrees.
## An angle of 0 will go from left to right, 180 will go from right to left,
## 90 will go from bottom to top and -90 from top to bottom.
popup_linear_gradient1_angle=-90

## Start and stop values tells at what point the gradient the gradient will start
## and stop. To make it work more or less the same no matter the size and ratio 
## of the popup, it's counted along one of the diagonals of the popup_style,
## which one depends on the angle. 
## If for example the start value is set to 25 and stop to 90,it means 
## that along the first 25 % of the diagonal only the start color will be shown. 
## After that the gradient will start to blend into the stop color and after
## 90 % of the the diagonal only stop color will be shown.
popup_linear_gradient1_start=0
popup_linear_gradient1_start_color="#313436"
popup_linear_gradient1_start_alpha=100
popup_linear_gradient1_stop=100
popup_linear_gradient1_stop_color="#313436"
popup_linear_gradient1_stop_alpha=100

## Radial gradients
## You can use up to three radial gradients at once and/or combine them with linear 
## gradients. Add the lines and change the number. Radial gradients are experimental
## and might rewritten completely later. Keep in mind that they use absolute values
## so they wont scale up when the popup gets bigger.
## 
## To use a radial gradient, just set use_popup_radial_gradient to 1.
#use_popup_radial_gradient1=0
## Radial gradients goes from one circle (x1, y1, radius1) to another (x2,y2, radius2).
## The values are comma separated.
##popup_radial_gradient1=50,30,10,50,30,100

## It starts from color1 at circle1 and goes to color2 at cirlce2
#popup_radial_gradient1_color1="#FFFFFF"
#popup_radial_gradient1_alpha1=25
#popup_radial_gradient1_color2="#FFFFFF"
#popup_radial_gradient1_alpha2=0

######## Window Item ###########
## The border color and alpha of the window item
## Alpha goes from 0 (completely transparent) to 100 (completely opaque)
## This alpha value works in both composited and non-composited window managers.

window_item_border_alpha=12

## The radius of the corner roundness for window items (in pixels).
window_item_roundness=0

## The padding of the window item left and right (lr) and top and bottom (td)
window_item_lr_padding=7
window_item_td_padding=14

## Alpha for the window item of the active window. 
## The is color set from preference not the style.
active_item_alpha=10

## The border for the window item of the active window. 
active_item_border_color="#009688"
active_item_border_alpha=25

## Color and alpha for the window items of windows that need attention.
needs_attention_item_color="#FF0000"
needs_attention_item_alpha=30


######## Menu Item #############

menu_item_border_color="#ffffff"
menu_item_border_alpha=50

## The radius of the corner roundness for menu items (in pixels).

## The padding of the menu item left and right (lr) and top and bottom (td)
menu_item_td_padding=30
menu_item_lr_padding=3



######## Close button ###########
## The size of the button
close_button_size=24

## The close buttons can be styled either by adding a folder called
## closebutton to the archive of the style and adding three png pictures
